# About the Project
The websites **tap.az**, **bina.az**, **turbo.az** and **boss.az** are well-known websites developed by **Digital Classifieds MMC** for user-made adds to sell consumer products, real estate, cars and list jobs respectively. The project scrapes the data from these websites periodically, saves them into databases for research purposes and also has self-updating data visualizations.
Currently, only **bina.az** is supported in this project.
## Scraping the Data
#### Dependencies
